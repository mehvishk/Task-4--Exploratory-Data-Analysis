🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that influenced passenger survival during the disaster.

The analysis focuses on understanding how factors such as **gender, passenger class, age, fare, family size, and embarkation port** impacted survival outcomes.

🎯 Objective

* Explore the dataset using statistical and visual techniques
* Identify key factors affecting survival
* Gain hands-on experience with real-world data analysis
* Build strong EDA and storytelling skills using Python

🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization

📂 Dataset Information

Dataset used: **Titanic – train.csv**

> Note: Only `train.csv` was used as it contains the target variable `Survived`, which is essential for EDA.

🔍 EDA Steps Performed

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Dataset structure analysis using `.info()` and `.describe()`
3. Handling missing values
4. Univariate analysis (Age, Fare, Survival distribution)
5. Bivariate analysis (Survival vs Gender, Class, Age, Fare)
6. Feature engineering (Family Size)
7. Correlation analysis using heatmap
8. Visual storytelling with observations

📊 Key Insights

* Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate
* First-class passengers were more likely to survive
* Higher fare passengers showed better survival chances
* Small families had higher survival rates compared to solo or large families
* Socio-economic factors strongly influenced survival outcomes

📄 Deliverables
✔ Jupyter Notebook with code, visualizations, and observations
✔ PDF report generated from the notebook (HTML to PDF conversion)

🚀 How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run cells sequentially
4. Review visualizations and observations

📌 Notes
* PDF was generated using HTML to PDF conversion due to Pandoc unavailability in Jupyter
* This is a beginner-friendly EDA project focused on insight generation rather than modeling
